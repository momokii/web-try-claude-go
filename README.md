# Web Based Scraping Project and LLM Integration using Claude & GPT

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects that showcase the implementation of web scraping combined with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude and GPT. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how data from various sources can be scraped and further analyzed or transformed using AI models.

In addition to web scraping and LLM integration, this project now includes **Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration for secure user authentication. The SSO implementation is based on [go-sso-web repository](https://github.com/momokii/go-sso-web), providing a seamless and secure authentication experience.

## **New Feature: Credit System Integration**
This project now includes a **credit system** integrated with the SSO authentication. Each mini-project consumes a different amount of credits, referred to as "feature cost," depending on the complexity of the processing required. The credit system ensures fair usage and allows users to manage their usage effectively.

## Overview

The project includes several mini-applications:

### **Mini Projects**
1. **Medium Account Roast**  
   A tool that scrapes data from a Medium account and generates a humorous "roast" or analysis of the content using LLMs. *(Feature Cost: 1 Credit Token)*
   
2. **Website Roast/Analysis**  
   This mini-project scrapes a website to get some topic inside it and, based on the topic selected by the user, performs a roast or detailed analysis using Claude or GPT, offering insights or an entertaining review. *(Feature Cost: 1 Credit Token)*

3. **Butterfly Effect Stories Generator**  
   A story generator that starts with a random title based on user input. The user then makes decisions throughout the story, influencing the final outcome like a "butterfly effect." This version includes a full audio rendition of the story once completed (using a TTS Model), as well as a custom cover image generated by an LLM image model (DALL-E). *(Feature Cost: 3 Credit Token)*

4. **Creative Content Generator**  
   This tool allows users to upload an image, which is analyzed to inspire various creative content options, such as poems, monologues, or short stories. The generated text can also be rendered into an audio format using LLM TTS (text-to-speech), and a custom cover image for the content is generated with an LLM image generator (DALL-E). *(Feature Cost: 3 Credit Token)*

## **How the Credit System Works**
- Users must authenticate via the SSO system.
- Each project feature has a predefined credit cost, displayed before execution.
- Users must have sufficient credits in their account to use a feature.
- Credits can be reset daily with user will give MAX 15 token.
- The system ensures fair usage and prevents excessive resource consumption.

This update ensures that resource-heavy features remain accessible while maintaining an efficient and fair usage model.

## Getting Started

### 1. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and fill it with your configuration settings with basic values from `.example.env`.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to ensure all necessary modules are installed:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
To start the development server, run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will start the server and automatically load changes when you rerun the command after making changes.

Alternatively, if you prefer using air for live reloading during development, simply run:

```bash
air
```

Make sure to configure air according to your project's needs by adjusting the settings in the .air.toml file.

### 4. Start the Production Server
To start the server in production mode, you can build the binary and run it:

#### On Windows:
```bash
go build -o lorem.exe
lorem.exe
```

#### On Linux/macOS:
```bash
go build -o lorem
./lorem
```
